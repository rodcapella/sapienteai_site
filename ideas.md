**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Swiss Modernism

**Core Principles**:
- Raw geometric shapes with precise mathematical grids
- Stark contrast between heavy black typography and electric blue accents
- Asymmetric layouts that break conventional centering
- Bold, unapologetic use of negative space as a structural element

**Color Philosophy**: 
Monochromatic foundation (deep navy #0a1628, pure white #ffffff) with surgical injections of electric blue (#0066ff) and copper (#c17d3a) only for interactive elements. The restraint creates tension; color becomes a reward for attention.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Diagonal-cut sections with overlapping layers. Hero content sits off-center in a 60/40 split. Text blocks anchor to invisible grid lines that create visual rhythm through repetition and variation.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick border frames around key sections (8px solid borders)
- Diagonal clip-path cuts between sections creating dynamic transitions
- Oversized numbers for process steps (120px+ display size)

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Micro-interactions are instant and mechanical—no easing curves, just snappy 150ms linear transitions. Hover states reveal hidden layers or shift elements along the grid.

**Animation**:
Elements slide in from grid positions on scroll with staggered delays. CTA buttons have a "stamp" effect on click. Section transitions use diagonal wipes that follow the clip-path aesthetic.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (700-900 weight) for headlines—geometric, technical
- Body: IBM Plex Sans (400-500) for readability with engineering precision
- Hierarchy: 72px hero / 48px section titles / 18px body / 14px labels

**Design Movement**: Liquid Modernism with Organic Futurism

**Core Principles**:
- Flowing, curved boundaries that suggest AI's fluid intelligence
- Gradient meshes and blur effects creating depth and atmosphere
- Content floats in space with soft shadows and glow effects
- Biomorphic shapes contrast with technical precision

**Color Philosophy**:
Deep space gradients (midnight blue #0d1b2a → electric cyan #00d4ff) create atmospheric depth. Warm copper (#d4a574) accents represent human touch in AI. Colors blend through mesh gradients, never hard edges—evoking neural networks and data flow.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Floating card system with parallax scrolling. Hero section uses a large circular gradient background with content orbiting around a central focal point. Sections overlap with transparency and backdrop-blur creating layered depth.

**Signature Elements**:
- Glassmorphism cards with backdrop-blur and subtle borders
- Animated gradient meshes that shift on scroll
- Circular progress indicators and orbital navigation dots

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Smooth, fluid animations with elastic easing (cubic-bezier). Elements respond to cursor proximity with magnetic attraction. Scrolling triggers parallax layers moving at different speeds.

**Animation**:
Fade-in with scale and blur transitions (0.95 → 1.0 scale). Gradient backgrounds animate continuously with CSS keyframes. CTA buttons have ripple effects and glow on hover.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Outfit (600-800) for modern, geometric headlines with rounded terminals
- Body: Inter Variable (400-500) with tight tracking for clean readability
- Hierarchy: 64px hero / 40px sections / 17px body / 13px captions

**Design Movement**: Deconstructed Minimalism with Editorial Influence

**Core Principles**:
- Extreme whitespace as the primary design material
- Typography as visual art—large scale text creates shapes
- Asymmetric grid system with intentional imbalance
- Restrained color palette with strategic accent placement

**Color Philosophy**:
Cream base (#faf8f5) with charcoal text (#1a1a1a) creates soft contrast reducing eye strain. Deep indigo (#1e3a8a) for primary actions, burnt sienna (#b8763f) for secondary. Colors appear only where action is required—the rest is typographic hierarchy.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Magazine-style editorial layout with large type lockups. Hero uses full-width text treatment with small body copy in a narrow column (max 45ch). Sections alternate between full-bleed and constrained widths creating rhythm.

**Signature Elements**:
- Oversized serif numerals as section markers (180px+)
- Thin horizontal rules (1px) as visual separators
- Pull quotes in accent color breaking up content flow

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Subtle and refined. Underlines appear on hover with smooth width transitions. Buttons have minimal borders with background fills on interaction. Focus on readability over spectacle.

**Animation**:
Gentle fade-ups with slight vertical translation (20px). Text reveals character-by-character on initial load. Scroll-triggered animations use intersection observer with threshold-based reveals.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Playfair Display (700-900) for elegant, high-contrast headlines
- Body: Source Sans 3 (400-600) for exceptional readability
- Hierarchy: 84px hero / 56px sections / 19px body / 15px metadata
